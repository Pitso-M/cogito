A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his\nonrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops,\nas Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He\nfires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.\n\nBEN'S VOICE\nRun, Luke! Run!\n\nLuke looks around to see where the voice came from.

An analysis of the plans\nprovided by Princess Leia has\ndemonstrated a weakness in the battle\nstation.\n\nArtoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping\nsounds, and turns his head from right to left.\n\nDODONNA\nThe approach will not be easy. You\nare required to maneuver straight\ndown this trench and skim the surface\nto this point. The target area is\nonly two meters wide. It's a small\nthermal exhaust port, right below\nthe main port. The shaft leads\ndirectly to the reactor system. A\nprecise hit will start a chain\nreaction which should destroy the\nstation.\n\nA murmer of disbelief runs through the room.\n\nDODONNA\nOnly a precise hit will set up a\nchain reaction. The shaft is ray-\nshielded, so you'll have to use proton\ntorpedoes.\n\nLuke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about\nsixteen years old.\n\nWEDGE\nThat's impossible, even for a\ncomputer.\n\nLUKE\nIt's not impossible. I used to bull's-\neye womp rats in my T-sixteen back\nhome. They're not much bigger than\ntwo meters.\n\nDODONNA\nMan your ships! And may the Force be\nwith you!\n\nThe group rises and begins to leave."

The young Jedi dashes away just\nahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of\nan earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his\nsalivating mouth.

The monster bellows in\nrage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an\navalanche.\n\nThe monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes\ninto a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the\nholding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility\ndoor--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into\nthe crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it\ndown on the Rancor's finger.\n\n19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT\n\nThe Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding\ncave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he\nsucceeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond\nthe gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the\nmonster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The\nguards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears,\nlaughing.\n\nLuke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for\nhim. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall.\nAs the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the\ncave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes\ncrashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on\nan egg.\n\nA startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation\nat this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning\nred with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh\ncommands to his guards and they hurry off.\n\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nBring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage."

Already know you that which you need.\n\nYoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.\n\nLUKE\nThen I am a Jedi?\n\nYODA\t (shakes his head)\nOhhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then,\nonly then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\n\nLuke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his\ncourage.

Luke kneels down, begins to\nhelp Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.\n\nLUKE\nI can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.\n\nBEN\t (OS)\nYoda will always be with you.\n\nLuke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.\n\nLUKE\nObi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\n\nThe ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.\n\nLUKE\nYou told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\n\nBEN\nYou father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be\nAnakin Skywalker\nand became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your\nfather was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a\ncertain point of view.\n\nLUKE\t (turning away, derisive)\nA certain point of view!\n\nBEN\nLuke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend\ngreatly on our own\npoint of view.\n\nLuke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.\n\nBEN\nI don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it\ncertainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened\nto your father was my fault.\n\nBen pauses sadly.\n\nBEN\nAnakin was a good friend.\n\nLuke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a\nstump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.\n\nBEN\nWhen I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was\namazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to\ntrain him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well\nas Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the\ngalaxy.\n\nLuke is entranced.\n\nLUKE\nThere's still good in him.\n\nBEN\nI also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be\ndone. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\n\nLUKE\nI can't do it, Ben.\n\nBEN\nYou cannot escape your destiny.\n\nLUKE\nI tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\n\nBEN\nVader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience\nwas part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value\nof patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you\ncould have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been\nprepared.\n\nLUKE\nBut I had to help my friends.\n\nBEN\t (grinning at Luke's indignation)\nAnd did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved\nlittle by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\n\nLUKE\t (with sadness)\nI found out Darth Vader was my father.\n\nBEN\nTo be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side\n- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest\ndoor - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what\nhe found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're\nno longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now,\nyou must face Darth Vader again!\n\nLUKE\nI can't kill my own father.\n\nBEN\nThen the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\n\nLUKE\nYoda spoke of another.\n\nBEN\nThe other he spoke of is your twin sister.\n\nLUKE\nBut I have no sister.\n\nBEN\nHmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your\nfather when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were\nto have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the\nreason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\n\nLUKE\nLeia! Leia's my sister.\n\nBEN\nYour insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They\ndo you credit.\nBut they could be made to serve the Emperor.\n\nLuke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.\n\nBEN\t (continuing his narrative)\nWhen your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your\nmother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep\nyou both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you\nto live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia\nto live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\n\nLuke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.\n\nBEN\t (attempting to give solace with his words)\nThe Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in\nthat system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew\nshe'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power,\nsince Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family\ncontinued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster\nfather's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of\ncourse... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the\ncorrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a\nvital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she\nwas doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had\nalways told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became\ndesperate.\n\nLuke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his\nsister.\n\nLUKE\nBut you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\n\nBEN\nShe hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have,\nLuke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your\nfamily. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy\nVader!"

One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree,\nslowing the scout.\n\nLUKE\nGet alongside that one!\n\nLeia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their\nsteering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of\nthe scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him\noff the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike\nand follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the\nremaining scout.\n\nLUKE\nGet him!\n\nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing\ninto pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser\ncannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a\nglancing hit.\n\nLUKE\t (indicating the one ahead)\nKeep on that one! I'll take these two!\n\nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into\nthe braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as\nthey zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and\nstarts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a\nmanner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted\nout of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.\n\nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into\nturbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.\n\nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom\nthrough the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and\nrises out of sight.\n\nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia\ndives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes\na glancing hit.\n\nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches\ndown, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has\nblasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike\nexplodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion.\nBut when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a\ngiant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a\nconflagration.\n\nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue\ntheir weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The\nscout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a\nbridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top\nand crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a\nwide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside\nhim makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all\nhis might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able\nto make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the\nscout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are\nmoving as one.\n\nAnother big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and\ndives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's\nexplodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find\nLuke.\n\nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and\nopens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and\nbegins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it\nappears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant,\nLuke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty\nslash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling,\nit rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire."

He seems somewhat\npuzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this\nfrightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up\nand stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where\nshe is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and\ndisheveled.\n\nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a\ndefensive position.

She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log\nbeside her.\n\nLEIA\nWell, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.\n\nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia\npats the log again.\n\nLEIA\nI promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.\n\nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.\n\nLEIA\nAll right. You want something to eat?\n\nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him.\nWicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously\ntoward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.\n\nLEIA\nThat's right. Come on. Hmmm?\n\nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the\nlog beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps\nback, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her\nand chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.\n\nLEIA\nLook, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery\nlittle thing, aren't you?\n\nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming\nto investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to\nsniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning\nto Leia.\n\nLEIA\nWhat is it?\n\nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log\nnext to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding\nbehind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears\nunderneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the\nforest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL\nSCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches\nout his hand for her weapon.\n\nSCOUT #l\nFreeze!  Come on, get up!\n\nShe hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage\nin front of the log.\n\nSCOUT #1\nGo get your ride and take her back to base.\n\nSCOUT #2\nYes, sir.\n\nThe second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the\nlog, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout\njumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled.\nLeia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol,\nand the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and\nhits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's\nbike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once\nmore. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards\nLeia with new respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking\naround all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the\ndense foliage.\n\nLEIA\nCome on, let's get outta here.\n\nAs they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and\ntugs at Leia to follow him."

Along one side, a\ngroup of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne.\nThe Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the\ntwo groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.\n\nThreepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's\nsqueaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally\nmurmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the\nRebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War,\nmimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers.\nThroughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable\nin English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-\nWan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.\n\nThreepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han\nSolo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.\n\nAt the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in\nagreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.\n\nThe drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer\nand screeches.\n\nHAN\nWhat's going on?\n\nLEIA\nI don't know.\n\nLuke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something\npasses like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not\nnotice.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\n\nSeveral of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.\n\nHAN\nJust what I always wanted.\n\nChewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket\nclings to Han's leg.\n\nHAN\t (chuckles)\nWell, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.\n\nThank you. Okay.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield\ngenerator.\n\nChewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders\noutside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.\n\nHAN\nGood. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try\nand get our weapons back.\n\nHan pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.\n\nHAN\t (cont)\nAnd hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day."

Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands\nstaring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, what's wrong?\n\nLuke turns and looks at her a long moment.\n\nLUKE\nLeia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\n\nLEIA\nJust a little bit. She died when I was very young.\n\nLUKE\nWhat do you remember?\n\nLEIA\nJust...images, really. Feelings.\n\nLUKE\nTell me.\n\nLEIA\n\nShe was very beautiful.

If I\ndon't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.\n\nLeia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and\ncould never have.\n\nLUKE\nYou're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to\nuse it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has\nit...I have it...and...my sister has it.\n\nLeia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she\ndoesn't draw away. She begins to understand.\n\nLUKE\nYes. It's you Leia.\n\nLEIA\nI know. Somehow...I've always known.\n\nLUKE\nThen you know why I have to face him.\n\nLEIA\nNo! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave\nthis place. I wish I could go with you.\n\nLUKE\nNo, you don't. You've always been strong.\n\nLEIA\nBut, why must you confront him?\n\nLUKE\nBecause...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to\nthe Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I\nhave to try.\n\nThey hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.\n\nLeia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He\ndisappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed\nin moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and\ncomes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only\nnow that she is crying.\n\nHAN\nHey, what's goin' on?\n\nLeia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.\n\nLEIA\nNothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.\n\nHAN\t (angry)\nNothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?\n\nShe looks up at him, struggling to control herself.\n\nLEIA\nI...I can't tell you.\n\nHAN\t (loses his temper)\nDid you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?\n\nLEIA\nI...\n\nHAN\nAhhh...\n\nHe starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.\n\nHAN\nI'm sorry.\n\nLEIA\nHold me.\n\nHan gathers her tightly in his protective embrace."

As six\nImperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids\nduck out of sight behind the tree.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWell, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?\n\nSTORMTROOPER\nFreeze! Don't move!\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe surrender.\n\nThe stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting\nquietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a\nband of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOhhh! Stand back, Artoo.\n\nIn a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK\nATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their\nfuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and\ntheir awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting\nEwoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the\ntrees above.\n\nIn the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for\nthe cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes\nto the bunker door control panel.\n\nLEIA\nThe code's changed. We need Artoo!\n\nHAN\nHere's the terminal.\n\nLEIA\t (into comlink)\nArtoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.\n\nArtoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround\nthem. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of\nwhistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked,\nruns after him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nGoing? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo?\nNo, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!\n\nBiker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the\nlittle Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.\n\nA group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They\nfire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns\nand heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks\nabandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker\nmoves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge\nlogs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.\n\nA line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's\nfoot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged\nbehind.\n\nTwo speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts\nround a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between\ntwo trees."

A special\ncoffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a\nsquad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to\nChewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is\nThreepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's\nand the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see\nwhat is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive,\nintermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The\nremaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back\nso that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.\n\nTHREEPIO\nIf only you had attached my legs,\nI wouldn't be in this ridiculous\nposition.  Now, remember, Chewbacca,\nyou have a responsibility to me,\nso don't do anything foolish.\n\nHAN\n\nWhat's going on... buddy?\n\nLANDO\nYou're being put into carbon freeze.\n\nBoba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.\n\nBOBA FETT\nWhat if he doesn't survive?  He's\nworth a lot to me.\n\nVADER\nThe Empire will compensate you\nif he dies.  Put him in!\n\nRealizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and\nattacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other\nImperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee\nwith their laser weapons.\n\nFrom the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in\npanic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop,\nChewbacca, stop...!\n\nThe stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.\n\nHAN\nStop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear\nme?  Stop!\n\nTHREEPIO\nYes, stop, please!  I'm not ready\nto die.\n\nHan breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him\ngo and the pirate breaks up the fight.\n\nHAN\nChewie!  Chewie, this won't help\nme.  Hey!\n\nHan gives the Wookiee a stern look.\n\nHAN\nSave your strength.  There'll be\nanother time.  The princess - you\nhave to take care of her.  You\nhear me?\n\nHan winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.\n\nIn a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too\ndistraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look\nsorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a\nfinal, passionate kiss.\n\nLEIA\nI love you!\n\nHAN\nI know.\n\nTears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to\nthe hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and\nthen, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in\nagony.\n\nLando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.\n\nInstantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and\nfluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns\naway from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat... what's going on?  Turn\nround, Chewbacca, I can't see.\nOh... they've encased him in\ncarbonite.  He should be quite\nwell-protected - if he survives\nthe freezing process, that is.\n\nChewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an\nangry glance and bark.\n\nA huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate\nout of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush\nover and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the\ncoffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it\ninside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step\naway.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He\nshakes his head in relief.\n\nVADER\nWell, Calrissian, did he survive?\n\nLANDO\nYes, he's alive.  And in perfect\nhibernation.\n\nVader turns to Boba Fett.\n\nVADER\nHe's all yours bounty hunter.\nReset the chamber for Skywalker.\n\nIMPERIAL OFFICER\nSkywalker has just landed, my\nlord.\n\nVADER\nGood.  See to it that he finds\nhis way here.  Calrissian, take\nthe princess and the Wookiee to\nmy ship.\n\nLANDO\nYou said they'd be left in the\ncity under my supervision.\n\nVADER\nI am altering the deal.  Pray I\ndon't alter it any further.\n\nLando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia,\nChewie, and Threepio."

Vader blocks the sword,\nbut looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The\nenergy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of\ncollapse.
