Children are domesticated the same way that we domesticate a dog, a cat, or any other animal.
In order to teach a dog we punish the dog and we give it rewards. 

We train our children whom we love so much the same way that we train any domesticated animal: with a system of punishment and reward. 

We are told, ‘You’re a good boy,’ or ‘You’re a good girl,’ when we do 
what Mom and Dad want us to do. When we don’t, we are a ‘bad girl’ or a ‘bad boy’.
